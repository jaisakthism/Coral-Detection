# Coral Reef Annotation and Localization using Faster R-CNN

This repository contains the model implementation, experiments, dataset configurations, and references for our research on *Coral Reef Anotation*. 
The work leverages **Faster R-CNN** architecture to enhance performance of coral reef anotation using the images large-scale collection of images taken from coral reefs 
around the world as part of a coral reef monitoring project with the Marine Technology Research Unit at the University of Essex

> ðŸ”¬ This research was conducted in collaboration with the  **School of Computer Science and Engineering** at **Vellore Institute of Technology, India** and **Machine Learning Research Group (MLRG)**.
